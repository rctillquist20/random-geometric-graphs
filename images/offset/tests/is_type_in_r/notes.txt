Maybe Ceil Exclusive Lower Quartile is best 1st option?

What is the worst offset?
If so, we can "remove" that subset from matrix.

"Favorness" level % by the number of popular common matrix elements it has
to make up that specific column.

I feel radius is a distraction because we can play the nodes anywhere.
The only thing radius gives us is a connection in which affects the column rows
elements. We have to be ready for anything, with or without radius at hand.

As well, I feel these node labels are a distraction, we must find a way to 
probability classify these nodes in order to get us a clear metric dimension.

Maybe there is a connection or why lowest or Ceil/Floor Exclusive Lower 
Quartile get chosen?
