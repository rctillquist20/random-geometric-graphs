1. Why is dataset 3 Ceil Exclusive Lower Quartile lower than lowest?
2. What did graphs did it miss? Did Lowest get the one graph Ceil Exclusive 
Lower Quartile did not get???


What is the worst offset?
If so, we can "remove" that subset from matrix.

"Favorness" level % by the number of popular common matrix elements it has
to make up that specific column.

I feel radius is a distraction because we can place the nodes anywhere.
The only thing radius gives us is a connection in which affects the column rows
elements. We have to be ready for anything, with or without radius at hand.

As well, I feel these node labels are a distraction, we must find a way to 
probability classify these nodes in order to get us a clear metric dimension.

Maybe there is a connection or why lowest or Ceil/Floor Exclusive Lower 
Quartile get chosen?

[0, 3] have the same number of element types but they never mix to form R in the OG photo...???

NEXT PLAN:
- Check if all Ceil Exclusive Lower Quartile missed are covered by Lowest Offset.
- TODO: Calculate which one offset can calculate that missing node graph from the previous pair. Triple threat algorithm.
