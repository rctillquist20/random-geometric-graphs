Family set (Best to worst):
- Floor median 
- Ceil median
- Lowest
- Highest

Random sets:
- Lowest
- Ceil Exclusive Upper Quartile
- Ceil Inclusive Upper Quartile (2, 3) or Floor median (4)
- Ceil Inclusive Lower Quartile (2) or Floor Exclusive Lower Quartile (3) or 
Ceil Inclusive Upper Quartile (4)

Seems to be (Fam + Ran):
- Floor Median
- Ceil Median or Lowest
- Highest

Ideas:
- Get data set with seeds that have no isolated vertices.
- Kind of doubting k - 1 isolated.
- Sharing top with same offset common value
- Is there at least 1 r set that contains the lowest and Ceil Exclusive Upper Quartile?

- Find the 1st pick best lowset offset node:
    - test

1. the sample minimum (smallest observation)
2. the lower quartile or first quartile
3. the median (the middle value)
4. the upper quartile or third quartile
5. the sample maximum (largest observation)

Looks like we do better in genral in the lower quartile.

Maybe use lowest score top 2 to help make multiple R sets??

import statistics

time_diff = [0.45,0.483333,0.5,0.516667,0.5333333]
statistics.quantiles(time_diff, method='inclusive')

Inclusive - Including the last number.
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] 

[3.25, 5.5, 7.75]


Exclusive - Excluding the last number.
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] 

[2.75, 5.5, 8.25]

In other words:
Python: Setting the method to “inclusive” is used for describing population
data or for samples that are known to include the most extreme values from the
population.

Inclusive: Refers to ranges that include the endpoints. For example, in the range 1 to 5 inclusive, both 1 and 5 are part of the set (i.e., {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}).
Exclusive: Refers to ranges that do not include the endpoints. For example, in the range 1 to 5 exclusive, the set would be {2, 3, 4} (1 and 5 are not included).

SECOND TEST:
- Percentiles (Ceil and Floor) compared with total original_total_offsets.
* 0th Percentile (P0): This is the minimum value in the dataset.
* 100th Percentile (P100): This is the maximum value in the dataset.
1 - 100%

Quantiles are the parts of Distribution cut up into pieces on where we find 
the median.

Wikipedia: IMPORTANT NOTES LEARNING
Common quantiles have special names, such as quartiles (four groups) (BOX and WHISKERS DIAGRAM), 
deciles (ten groups), and percentiles (100 groups). 

The 25th quantile is also known as the first quartile, or Q1, and is the
value at which 25% of data points fall below it when the data is arranged in
increasing order.

- Upper Quartile (Upper median) (Inclusive or EXCLUSIVE, Ceil or FLOOR)
- Lower Quartile (Lower Median) (Inclusive or EXCLUSIVE, Ceil or FLOOR)

Work with the most commonly used quantiles have special names:

Quartiles (4-quantiles): Three quartiles split the data into four parts.
Deciles (10-quantiles): Nine deciles split the data into 10 parts.
Percentiles (100-quantiles): 99 percentiles split the data into 100 parts

so the value in 15% of the data?
The 15th quantile represents the value below which 15% of the data lies. 
In other words, if you have a dataset of 100 values, the 15th quantile would 
be the value below which 15 of those values fall

To calculate the quartile you take the median between 2 values when there is a
tie for the 25th quartile.
