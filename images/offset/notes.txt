Family set (Best to worst):
- Floor median 
- Ceil median
- Lowest
- Highest
Random sets:
- Lowest
- Floor Median or Ceil Median
- Highest

Seems to be (Fam + Ran):
- Floor Median
- Ceil Median or Lowest
- Highest

Ideas:
- Get data set with seeds that have no isolated vertices.
- Kind of doubting k - 1 isolated.
